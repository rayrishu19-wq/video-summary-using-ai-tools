I can summarize your video using AI — but first, please upload the video file here (any common format like .mp4, .mov, .avi, etc.), or paste a YouTube link if it’s online.

Once you share it, I’ll:

Transcribe the video (turn speech into text).

Analyze the content to identify key points, topics, and tone.

Provide a concise AI-generated summary, and if you want, also:

Bullet-point highlights

Chapter/time-stamped summary

Action items or insights (for lectures or meetings)
